                <strong>Award Issuer:</strong> The user whos award issuing
                history you'd like to review. If you "Select All" then the
                results displayed will take into account all the awards issued
                regardless of who the issuer was. <br><br>
                <strong>Breakdown By:</strong> If you choose to breakdown by
                Region you will see a chart depicting the amounts of awards
                issued to each region. If you choose to breakdown by Department
                you will see a chart depicting the amounts of awards issued to
                each department. <br><br>
                <strong>From and To:</strong> You can further restrict the terms                of your search by setting a date range. For example, if you
                were only interested in seeing the awards issued between April 1                st 2019 and April 30th 2019 you would set the "From" date to 04/                01/2019 and the "To" date to 05/01/2019. The "To" date is not
                inclusive so it should be set one day ahead of the date you
                actually want. If you just want to view all records after a
                particular date only fill in a "From" date. Likewise, if you
                only want to see records before a certain date, only fill in the                "To" date. Finally, if you don't want to filter records by time
                simply do not enter in any dates in either "To" or "From"
                 <br><br><br>
